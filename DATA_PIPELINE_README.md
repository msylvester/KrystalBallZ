# Data Processing Pipeline for Vector Database Ingestion

## Overview
This document demonstrates the data transformation process from raw scraped job data to vector database-ready format.

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Raw Scraped Data
- Direct output from web scraping
- Inconsistent formatting
- May contain duplicates
- Minimal validation

### Stage 2: Standardized Data
- Cleaned and normalized text
- Extracted metadata (tech stack, experience level)
- Consistent field names and formats
- Quality validation applied

### Stage 3: Vector-Ready Format
- Optimized text for embedding
- Structured metadata for filtering
- Unique IDs for deduplication
- Ready for vector database insertion

### Stage 4: Embedded Data (Future)
- Numerical vector representations added
- Ready for semantic search
- Can be inserted into vector databases

## File Outputs
- `raw_jobs_*.json` - Original scraped data
- `processed_jobs_*.json` - Cleaned and standardized
- `vector_ready_jobs_*.json` - Optimized for embedding
- `jobs_with_embeddings.json` - Final format (when ready)

## Running the Demo
```bash
python data_format_demo.py
```

This will show the complete data transformation pipeline with sample data.
